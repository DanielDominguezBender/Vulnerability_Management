# Vulnerability Management

In this repository I would like to show a little example of vulnerability management using tools like Nessus or Qualys.  

## What is Vulnerability Management?  

Vulnerability management is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that involves the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, applications, and other digital assets. A vulnerability, is a weakness that can be exploited by a thread and so compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or data.  
In a shorter context, vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilites.
