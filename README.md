# Vulnerability Management

In this repository I would like to show a little example of vulnerability management using tools like Nessus or Qualys.  

## What is Vulnerability Management?  

Vulnerability management is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that involves the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, applications, and other digital assets. A vulnerability, is a weakness that can be exploited by a thread and so compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or data.  
In a shorter context, vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilites.  

The vulnerability management is a 4 steps process:  

1) Identify vulnerabilities
2) Consider potential exploits (is a way of taking advantage of vulnerabilities) 
3) Prepare defenses against threads
4) Evaluate those defenses

## Differences between risk, thread and vulnerability  

Understanding the concepts of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities is fundamental in the field of cybersecurity. Let's break down each of these terms:  
  
<b>Risk:</b> In the context of cybersecurity, risk refers to the potential for harm or loss resulting from the exploitation of vulnerabilities. It's the likelihood that a threat actor will exploit a vulnerability and the impact that this exploitation could have on an organization's assets, data, operations, and reputation. Risk is a combination of the probability of an incident occurring and the potential consequences if it does occur.  
<b>Threat:</b> A threat is any potential danger that can exploit a vulnerability to breach security and thereby cause harm. Threats can be human, environmental, or technological in nature. They encompass various forms of attacks, including cyberattacks, physical attacks, natural disasters, and more. Threats are not limited to hackers or malware; they also include actions like accidental data leaks or insider breaches.  
<b>Vulnerability:</b> A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in a system's design, implementation, or configuration that could be exploited by a threat actor to compromise the security of the system. Vulnerabilities can exist in software, hardware, network configurations, and even in human processes. They are the gaps that threat actors look to exploit in order to carry out attacks.  

These are pretty complex concepts of what is what, so let's try to make it clearer with the 'Castle Analogy':  
  
Imagine a castle (the system) with its walls, moat and guards (the security measures) to protect the treasure (the valuable data).  
In this scenario the previously explained concepts would be:  

<b>Risk:</b>: The risk would be the likelihood that the enemy army successfully breaches the castle's defenses (exploits the vulnerability) and the potential consequences of this breach (stealing the treasure and potentially causing damage to the castle).  
<b>Threat:</b>: The threat would be the potential danger that could exploit the vulnerability. This could be represented by an enemy army planning to attack the castle to steal the treasure.  
<b>Vulnerability:</b>: A vulnerability would be a weak point in the castle's defenses, such as a damaged section of the wall or a hidden entrance that the guards don't know about.
