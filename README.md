# Vulnerability Management

In this repository I would like to show a little example of vulnerability management using tools like Nessus or Qualys.  

## What is Vulnerability Management?  

Vulnerability management is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that involves the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, applications, and other digital assets. A vulnerability, is a weakness that can be exploited by a thread and so compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system or data.  
In a shorter context, vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilites.  

The vulnerability management is a 4 steps process:  

1) Identify vulnerabilities
2) Consider potential exploits (a way of taking advantage of vulnerabilities) 
3) Prepare defenses against threads
4) Evaluate those defenses

## Differences between risk, thread and vulnerability  

Understanding the concepts of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities is fundamental in the field of cybersecurity. Let's break down each of these terms:  
  
<b>Risk:</b> Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.  
<b>Threat:</b> Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.  
<b>Vulnerability:</b> A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.  
  
These are pretty complex concepts of what is what, so let's try to make it clearer with the 'Castle Analogy':  
  
Imagine a castle (the system) with its walls, moat and guards (the security measures) to protect the treasure (the valuable data).  
In this scenario the previously explained concepts would be:  

<b>Risk:</b> The risk would be the likelihood that the enemy army successfully breaches the castle's defenses (exploits the vulnerability) and the potential consequences of this breach (stealing the treasure and potentially causing damage to the castle).  
<b>Threat:</b> The threat would be the potential danger that could exploit the vulnerability. This could be represented by an enemy army planning to attack the castle to steal the treasure.  
<b>Vulnerability:</b> A vulnerability would be a weak point in the castle's defenses, such as a damaged section of the wall or a hidden entrance that the guards don't know about.  

## Vulnerability Managment tools  

There are numerous vulnerability assessment and management tools available to help organizations identify and address security vulnerabilities in their systems, networks, applications and other digital assets. These tools vary in terms of their features, capabilities and complexity. Some well-known vulnerability assessment tools are:  
  
<b>Nessus:</b> Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanner that helps identify security flaws, misconfigurations, and other vulnerabilities in networks and systems. It offers both free and paid versions and provides detailed reports and remediation guidance.

<b>OpenVAS:</b> OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanner that provides comprehensive vulnerability assessment capabilities, including detection of known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security issues.

<b>Qualys:</b> Qualys offers a cloud-based vulnerability management solution that scans networks, web applications, and endpoints for vulnerabilities. It provides continuous monitoring and detailed reports.
