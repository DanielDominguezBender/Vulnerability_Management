# Example of how the vulnerability tool Nessus works  

## Nessus  

Nessus is one of the most widely used vulnerability scanners. Is from the so-called generic, since it does not focus on the web part or the part of systems. Nessus is a scanner that has plugins to run every type of tests: web, systems, white box, gray box, based on requirements legal sites (PCI-DSS), etc. It has a version for students with which you can test and see the potential of the tool.  

## How does Nessus work?  
  
The operation of Nessus is as follows:  

1) Nessus presents a web page on port 8834 where you must enter your access credentials. In the installation process you will configure a user and password.
2) Nessus works through templates. the tool brings a series of templates that are nothing more than scan types.
3) Different templates mark whether the scan is white, black or gray box.
4) Nessus offers all sorts of tests depending on whether it is web or system, or if it is white or black box.
5) Another of Nessus' strengths is being able to create scans with the custom tests.
6) Nessus has more than fourteen thousand plugins. A complement is a type of test that the tool will run.
7) The tool generates a report with the results and vulnerabilities detected.

## Visual example  

What I have used for this example is a Virtual Windows 11 machine using UTM. For the purpose of this example, I've installed a deprecated version of Google Chrome Browser in order to perform some vulnerability scans on the machine.
